def heom_sb_details():
    details=" \n ****************************************************************\n  In the spin-boson calculations, \
we consider both symmetric and asymmetric cases and for each case, we generate 500 trajectories. \
The data is generated with the HEOM method implemented in the QuTip package (v.2.6)  [https://qutip.org/]. \
The hierarchy depth \'L\' was set 30 and the number of Mastsubara terms \'K\'  was changed with temperature, i,e., \
beta = 0.1 K = 2, beta = 0.25 K = 3, beta = 0.5 K = 3, beta = 0.75 K = 4, beta = 1.0 K = 5. The time-step for \
propagation was set to dt = 0.05 and values were recorded for each dt = 0.1. \
In spin-boson model, the Hamiltonian is written as \n H = [epsilon,  Delta \n     Delta*,  0] \n. For symmetric case, epsilon is 0 and we set it to 1 for asymmetric case. For both cases, Delta is 1. \n From the database, the data \
and the corresponding parameters can be extracted as;  You can pass \
an extraction choice with keyword \"function(extr_choice: choice)\". \
The choice here is \'all\', \'sym\', \'asym\' or \'cal_details\' \
which extracts data for the corresponding choice. The default choice is the 'cal_details' which \
provides details about the calculations. \n \n  From the output of the function, you can access the data \
as: \'output.data\' (for trajectories), \'output.N_trajs\' (total number of trajectories), \
\'output.epsilon\' (energy difference between the two states), \'output.Delta\' (interaction strength between the two states)  \
,\'output.gamma\' (the cutoff frequencies for all trajectories), \'output.lamb\' (the system-bath \
coupling strengths for all trajectories) and the \'output.beta\' (inverse temperature values for all trajectories).\
\n \n  It is worth-emphasizing that \'output.data\' is a dictionary and to extract the data, you can use \
\'xyz=list(output.data.values())\', where \'xyz[i]\' gives you the ith trajectory \
corresponding to the ith value in the epsilon, Delta, gamma ,lamb and  temp (all parameters are in atomic units).\
