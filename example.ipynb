            "  In the spin-boson calculations, we consider both symmetric and asymmetric cases and for each case, we generate 500 trajectories. The data is generated with the HEOM method implemented in the QuTip package (v.2.6)  [https://qutip.org/]. The hierarchy depth 'L' was set 30 and the number of Mastsubara terms 'K'  was changed with temperature, i,e., beta = 0.1 K = 2, beta = 0.25 K = 3, beta = 0.5 K = 3, beta = 0.75 K = 4, beta = 1.0 K = 5. The time-step for propagation was set to dt = 0.05 and values were recorded for each dt = 0.1. In spin-boson model, the Hamiltonian is written as \n",
